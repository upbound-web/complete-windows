- If not, you'll need to re-do the changes
- **Always save before closing!**

### "I made a mistake and want to undo"
- Click "Edit Mode: OFF" then refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- This will reload your last saved version
- Or load a previous backup file

### "The image won't change"
- Make sure the image URL is correct and accessible
- Try using a direct image link (ending in .jpg, .png, etc.)
- Check that the image isn't too large (under 2MB recommended)

### "I accidentally deleted important text"
- Turn off Edit Mode and refresh the page
- Load your most recent backup
- If you don't have a backup, contact your developer

Your changes are saved locally in your browser. To share them:
1. Download a backup file
2. Send it to someone else
3. They can load it on their computer

### For a Real Website (With Server)
After making changes, you need to:
1. Download your backup file
2. Contact your web developer

**OR** if you're using GitHub Pages or similar:
